# artix-luks-base-install

#### You should always try to read/understand any code that you execute, especially installation scripts like these.
##### Questions(Issues)/PR's are welcome.

A fully self-contained Artix Linux base installation script that installs the
base system with an encrypted disk on /root and /swap using cryptsetup.

The installer is only configured to work with EFI+NVME systems and installs the runit
init system by default. By default it allocates 8G for /swap and
everything else for /root. This should be sufficient for most configurations.

Features:
- Simple menu to define password/user/hostname.
- NVME only.
- EFI only.
- Encrypted /root and /swap using LVM on LUKS encryption.
- Runit init system (replaces systemd).
- Configures defaults for locale, sudoers and networking.
- Well documented script.
- As little bloat as possible.
